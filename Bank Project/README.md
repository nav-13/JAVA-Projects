# PROBLEM(Why I Made This APP)
The reasoning behind developing this app is,as a cashier at the bank,whenever we are handed money,we have to count it by hand,write the cash breakdown and then save the following amount and check whether it matches the amount the customer has said.
The problem is that using a calculator is tedious and takes very long especially when the customers want the service to be done as quick as possibe.scenario of the issues faced as cashier and the steps needed to work it out on the calculator.
Customer has X amount,now the steps on the calculator
1)50 Times Z=Amount
2)20 Times Z=Amount
3)10 Times *Z=Amount
4)5 Times Z=Amount
5)50Z+20Z+10Z+5Z=TA
6)TA-X(to check if both amounts are correct)
